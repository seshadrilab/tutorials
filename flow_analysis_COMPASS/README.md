# Flow Cytometry R Analysis Tutorial: COMPASS

NOTE: Due to [issues](https://github.com/RGLab/COMPASS/issues/81#issuecomment-2322610825) with CompassContainerFromGatingSet, we have switched from COMPASS to SimpleCOMPASS. You can find a SimpleCOMPASS tutorial on the COMPASS Bioconductor [page](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/COMPASS.html) under Documentation.
